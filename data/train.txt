You're the one who's always choking \t You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Sleep may be the enemy \t But so's another line
It's a remedy \t You should take more time
You're the one who's always choking \t You're the one who's showers always golden
Spunk and bestiality well it's an Assisi lie \t It's ahead of me
You should close your fly \t I understand the fascination
The dream that comes alive at night \t But if you don't change your situation
Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die \t Please don't die
You're the one who's always choking \t You're the one who's always bruised and broken
Drunk on immorality \t Valium and cherry wine
Coke and ecstasy \t You're gonna blow your mind
I understand the fascination \t I've even been there once or twice or more
But if you don't change your situation \t Then you'll die, you'll die, don't die, don't die
